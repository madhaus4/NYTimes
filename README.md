### Reflection
The intended timeline for this project was 8 hours.  I went a little over and landed around 10 hours.  Grid was a challenge for me to use on this project, I think because I wanted a tricky layout so that took some time.  I ended up scrapping that idea so I could move on and complete the MVP.  The use of my project board and wireframe helped me stay on track with the design and timeframe overall.
